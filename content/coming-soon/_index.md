### Full site coming soon!

The site will be up shortly along this HUGO theme. I am currently in the process to collecting and updating all my relevant projects and research interests in one place. However, I feel that if I waited for the time where I have collected it all, I'll end up waiting for a very long time. 

### About the theme

After going through the [Hugo Showcase](https://gohugo.io/showcase/) for a theme, I was inspired to create a simple yet beautiful portfolio theme that can cater to the likes of analysts, researchers, journalists etc, or someone who needs a simple, crisp blogpage. This gave birth to __inatrty-ui__. 
This theme takes inspiration from Financial Times print for the color pallette and the font. The FT color combination lends a certain professional, fact oriented feel to the website. 

In future updates, I'll try to create BI dashboard and blog pages with similar combination.  


It will be difficult to customize parts/sections of the website due to how it is structured, but I have an idea on how to go about resolving that, and would attempt to implement that next.
